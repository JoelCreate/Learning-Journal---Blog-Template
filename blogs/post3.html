                <h3 class="h3">I always went back to coding for fun on my free time!</h3>
                <p>Learning to code is something that I never thought I would be interested in. But as technology continues to evolve, it's becoming increasingly important to have at least a basic understanding of how things work.</p>
                <p>For me, the main reason I decided to learn to code was because I wanted to be more self-sufficient in my work. As a graphic designer, I often have to rely on developers to bring my designs to life. But with coding skills, I could take on more of that responsibility myself and create more interactive and dynamic designs.</p>    
                <p>Another reason I wanted to learn to code was simply because I found it fascinating. The idea of being able to create something from scratch, to build something that works, and to be able to solve problems with technology was something that really appealed to me.</p> 
                <p>Finally, I also saw learning to code as a way to future-proof my career. With more and more jobs requiring some level of coding knowledge, having those skills could open up new opportunities and make me more valuable in the job market.</p> 
                <p>I learned to code because I wanted to expand my skill set, be more self-sufficient, and future-proof my career. And while it hasn't always been easy, the sense of accomplishment that comes with creating something from scratch is definitely worth it.</p>
