                <h3 class="h3">CSS FUNdamentals!</h3>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a fundamental building block of modern web design. It is a styling language used to control the layout and presentation of HTML documents on the web. </p>
                <h3 class="h3">CSS is to websites as fashion is to people.</h3>
                <p><span class="strong">Selectors:</span> CSS selectors are used to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. A selector could be a tag name, class, ID, or attribute of an element.</p>    
                <p><span class="strong">Properties:</span> CSS properties define how an element should be styled. For example, you could set the font size, color, or background of an element using properties.</p> 
                <p><span class="strong">Values:</span> CSS values are assigned to properties to define how they should be applied. For example, a value for the color property could be "red", "#FF0000", or "rgb(255, 0, 0)".</p>
                <p><span class="strong">Cascade and specificity:</span> CSS rules can conflict with each other, and the order of precedence is determined by the cascade and specificity. The last rule defined or the most specific rule takes precedence.</p>    
                <p>By mastering these fundamentals, you'll be well on your way to creating beautiful and functional web designs with CSS. As with any skill, practice and experimentation are key to improving your CSS abilities.</p>
