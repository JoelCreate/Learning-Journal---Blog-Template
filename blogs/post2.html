                <div class="blog-description">
                    <p class="p">I began coding by taking the front end developer course on Scrimba and became fascinated with the ability to create software and solve complex problems.</p>

                <h3 class="h3">Scrimba was the answer!</h3>
                <p>When I first started learning to code, I was overwhelmed with the number of resources available online. I tried a few different websites, but I was always left feeling like I hadn't made much progress.
                </p>
                <p>Then, I discovered Scrimba, and everything changed. Scrimba's interactive platform allowed me to learn by doing, which was exactly what I needed. I could watch a video tutorial, pause it, and then immediately start coding alongside the instructor. This helped me solidify my understanding of the concepts much better than simply reading or watching a lecture.
                </p>    
                <p>One of the things that drew me to Scrimba was the community aspect. I could ask questions and get feedback from other learners and even the instructors themselves. This helped me feel more connected to the material and motivated me to keep going.
                </p> 
                <p>As I progressed through the courses on Scrimba, I started to feel more confident in my coding abilities. I could see how much progress I had made in just a few weeks, and it was a great feeling. Scrimba's curriculum also covers a wide range of topics, from HTML and CSS to advanced JavaScript concepts, so I never felt like I was running out of things to learn.
                </p> 
                <p>Overall, my experience with Scrimba has been fantastic. It's the perfect platform for anyone who wants to learn to code in an interactive and engaging way. I'm excited to see where my coding career will take me next, and I know that Scrimba will be there to support me every step of the way.</p>
